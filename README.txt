 A simple ATM program. We assume that the correct PIN is 6364 and the user must enter exactly that for the account options to appear and for the program  to continue.
 We try to catch any exceptions with the try/catch blocks. The program has some very basic
 options like see balance, withdraw money, deposit money and exit the program.
